Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

1) Objects are important data types in javascript,
   Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.). 
2) Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. 
   These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
3) Every object has some property associated with some value. These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.
4) Object methods
   An object method is an object property containing a function definition
   Let’s assume to start the car there will be a mechanical functionality.and so similar is to stop/brake/headlights on & off, etc.
   So, conclusion and simple definition for Java Script Object methods is Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
5)  One of easiest way to create a javascript object is object literal, simply define the property and values inside curly braces,
6) Objects are complex and each object may contain a combination of primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
7) An object is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value.
   That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. 
8) The variables don’t actually store the value.
9) therway around, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, 
   in the form of “key: value” pairs. 
10) These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
11) An object can be created with figure brackets {} with an optional list of properties. 
12) A property is a “key: value” pair, where a key is the property name value can be anything.
