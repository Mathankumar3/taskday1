HTTP 1.1
1) Introduced in 1997
2) internet landsscape was constantly changing with websites becoming more dynamic and heavy
3) Features like cors,keep-alive (most important one) was introduced in this update,
4) HOL-head of line blocking
5) Repeatition of header data
6) More focuss on ggzip,minifying css/js,cachingg.
7) That specification was obsoleted by RFC 2616 in 1999, which was likewise replaced by the RFC 7230 family of RFCs in 2014.
8) HTTP is a protocol which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents. 
9) It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol,
   which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. 
10) A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.

HTTP 2.0
1) Hpack: Header data is separate from request data and can be zipped.
2) HPACK also enables reuse of header data which is repeated in every request,
3) HPACK reduces HTTP request size.
4) PUSH: push framess enables us to send mandatory resources in advance along with an HTTP respones,
5) PUSH frames should be used with care as this can lead to increase in size of the HTTP response,
6) you can keep on using gzip,leverage browser caching, minify css/js,to further improve the speed.
7) almost all the modern web servers support this,
8) do not worry about losing users as users using old browsers with support of HTTP 11.1 will be served the website over HTTP1.1 only,
9) HTTP/2 (originally named HTTP/2.0) is a major revision of the HTTP network protocol used by the World Wide Web.
   It was derived from the earlier experimental SPDY protocol, originally developed by Google.
10) HTTP/2 was developed by the HTTP Working Group (also called httpbis, where "bis" means "second") of the Internet Engineering Task Force. 
11) HTTP/2 is the first new version of HTTP since HTTP 1.1, which was standardized in RFC 2068 in 1997. 
12) The Working Group presented HTTP/2 to IESG for consideration as a Proposed Standard in December 2014, 
and IESG approved it to publish as Proposed Standard on February 17, 2015. 
13) The HTTP/2 specification was published as RFC 7540 in May 14, 2015.
14) The standardization effort was supported by Chrome, Opera, Firefox, Internet Explorer 11, Safari, Amazon Silk, and Edge browsers. 
Most major browsers had added HTTP/2 support by the end of 2015.
